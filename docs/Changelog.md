v0.1 - serial function for metadata pulling
v0.2 - added error logging
v0.3 - added error checking, and re-trying API calls if the API call fails
v0.4 - added parallelization support using `concurrent.futures` `ThreadPoolExecutor` `as_completed`
v0.5 - For 0.5, I need to add the XML parsing functionality. This will ensure all files are written as standard tab-delimed files without nested XML structures.
